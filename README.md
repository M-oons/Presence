# Presence

Presence allows you to set a custom rich presence activity on Discord.

To start, create an application on the [Discord developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

- The `Application Client ID` field in Presence will be the 18 character `Client ID` displayed on your application page. The name of your application will be used as the "Playing..." status on Discord.
- The `Details` and `State` fields will be displayed underneath the name of your application in your Discord activity.
- The `Large Image` and `Small Image` fields will be the names of the images that you add to your application on the Discord application art assets page. `https://discord.com/developers/applications/<Your Application Client ID>/rich-presence/assets` 
- The `Large Image Text` and `Small Image Text` fields will be the text that is displayed in a bubble when you hover your mouse over the respective image in your Discord activity.
- `Show Timestamp` determines whether or not the timestamp should be displayed in your Discord activity. The timer initially starts when Presence is launched and can be reset, see below.
- `Reset Timestamp On Update` is used to reset the timestamp to start from the current time when you click `Update Presence`.

Presence will minimize to the Windows system tray when the "X" button in the top right of the window is clicked and will be shown again when the tray icon is clicked.
